#Kafka Broker Discovery:
========================

    . Kafka broker is also called a "bootstrap server"
    . That means that you only need to connect to one broker,
        and you will be connected to the entire cluster.
    . Each broker knows about all brokers, topics and partitions(metadata)

#ZooKeeper:
===========

    . Zookeeper manager brokers(keeps a list of them)
    . Zookeeper helps in performing leader election for partitions
    . Zookeeper sends notifications to kafka in case of changes(e.g
        new topic, broker dies, broker comes up, delete topics, etc...)
    . Kafka can't work without Zookeeper
    . ZooKeeper by design operates with an odd number of servers
    . Zookeeper has a leader(handle writes) the rest of the servers are
        followers(handle reads)
    . Zookeeper does NOT store consumer offset
